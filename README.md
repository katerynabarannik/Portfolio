# Hi, I`m Kateryna Barannik! 
#### *I`m open to work*
 
I am Junior with strong desire to grow and improve in the field of Quality Assurance. I have learnt functional and non-functional testing during my software testing training. I have executed a Dare IT Challenge in software testing where I used automation testing tool Selenium WebDriver (Python, Robot Framework) to automate some of the commonly used features of the Web pages. I have written test cases for the manual execution and reported defects in Jira and Test Rail during my course at QA Light Academy. The last, but not least, I really want to grow and improve in the QA sphere!

# ðŸ‘€ About me
Combining study with work, I managed to gain a lot of experience and build a career in the company. Working my way up from waiter to general manager, I learned many different skills and learned how to work with people and build teams. I am passionate about travelling and my huge dream is to visit more than 100 countries :)
